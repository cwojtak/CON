# CON
CON is a language designed for beginner coders to understand programming logic and basic object-oriented programming,
and is planned to also be used as a language that has practical purposes(think [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/)).

Since CON is currently in development, Visual Studio project files, test files, and other junk will be included with these current updates.

### **_CON is also not currently usable at this point!_**
